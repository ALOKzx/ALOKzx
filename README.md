## ✨ A Bit About Me

- 🧑‍💻 I prefer **learning by building** over textbooks
- 🎯 I get deeply focused once I lock into a task (sometimes too much 😅)
- 📚 I'm learning how to **balance focus with flexibility** and avoid distractions
- 🧩 I believe in using AI as a tool, not a crutch — always aiming for **clarity over shortcuts**
- ☕ Skipping college classes to code? Guilty... but I make it count.
